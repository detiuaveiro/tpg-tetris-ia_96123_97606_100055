things to implement

- cache for command calculations (credit Rodrigo)
- error recovery method: check if previous command sent was properly received, repeat it otherwise (may help recover from desyncs)

- find first column of contact between piece and floor (jรก tinhamos descoberto isto, why not implemented??)
